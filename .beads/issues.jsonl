{"id":"mage-1yh","title":"Measure output is non-deterministic across runs","description":"Two runs of cobbler:measure against the same project state produce different issues. The root cause is that the prompt gives Claude freedom on decisions that should be pinned in specifications.\n\nObserved differences between runs:\n- File naming (difftest.go vs testutils.go)\n- Struct shape (*FileExpectation vs map[string][]byte)\n- Timeout configurability choices\n- Requirement granularity (9 requirements vs 6)\n\n## Required fixes (ordered by impact)\n\n### 1. Pin design decisions in specs, not the prompt (highest impact)\nThe PRD leaves implementation choices open (file names, struct shapes, timeout config). The measure agent invents them differently each time. Fix: add these decisions to the PRD or use case directly. If prd001-testutils.yaml specifies \"the main file is difftest.go\" and \"use a FileExpectation struct, not a map\", Claude has nothing to invent.\n\n### 2. Add a golden example for the target utility\nThe prompt has a generic abstract example (ExampleType, pkg/types/example.go). A domain-specific example — a completed measure-issues.yaml from a previous successful generation — would anchor the style, granularity, and naming conventions. Add an examples field to the prompt that includes an actual previous approved issue.\n\n### 3. Constrain requirement granularity in planning constitution\nThe planning constitution (P2) constrains lines of code and file count, but says nothing about how many requirements or acceptance criteria to produce. One run gave 9 requirements, the other gave 6. Add a rule like \"target 5-8 requirements per code task\" to reduce this axis of variation.\n\n### 4. Prescribe file naming conventions\nNeither the prompt nor the constitution tells the model what to name Go source files. Add a rule to the planning constitution or a design decision in the PRD: \"name the main source file after the primary exported type or function, not the package name.\"\n\n### 5. Lower temperature (if the orchestrator supports it)\nThe orchestrator calls Claude via CLI. If it passes through API parameters, setting temperature: 0 would reduce randomness. This won't eliminate variance but helps.\n\n### 6. Post-hoc validation / schema enforcement\nAdd a validation step after measure that checks the output against a stricter schema — e.g., file names must match a pattern, struct form not map, requirement count within range. Reject and re-run if it doesn't conform.\n\n## Files to modify\n- pkg/orchestrator/measure.go — add temperature parameter, validation step\n- Default prompt templates (prompts/measure.yaml) — add golden example field\n- Default constitution (constitutions/planning.yaml) — add requirement granularity and file naming rules\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Two consecutive runs of measure against the same project state produce structurally equivalent issues\n- [ ] File names, struct shapes, and requirement counts are consistent\n- [ ] Golden example mechanism implemented and documented","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T03:46:27Z","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-24T03:46:52Z"}

Top-level groups for PRDs and test suites. Refreshes via FileSystemWatcher on docs/specs/.\n\nR9 - Code-to-Spec Traceability: CodeLensProvider for Go source files. Detects comments with pattern '// prd: \u003cprd-id\u003e \u003creq-id\u003e' and '// uc: \u003cuc-id\u003e'.
