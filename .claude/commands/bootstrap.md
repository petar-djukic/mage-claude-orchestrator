# Command: Bootstrap Project

I'm starting a new project and need you to help me create the initial epics and issues to structure the work.

First, read **docs/CONSTITUTION-design.yaml** to understand the documentation format rules and available document types (VISION, ARCHITECTURE, PRD, use case, test suite, etc.).

Then ask me questions to understand:
1. What problem I'm trying to solve
2. What the solution will do
3. What success looks like
4. What the major components are
5. How those components fit together
6. Key design decisions and why

Based on my answers, create epics and issues using the bead system:

## Epic Structure
Create a main epic that captures the overall project vision and scope.

## Child Issues

Break down the work into specific issues for:

- **Documentation**: VISION.yaml, ARCHITECTURE.yaml, PRDs
- **Core Implementation**: Major components and features
- **Infrastructure**: Build, test, deployment setup
- **Integration**: Component wiring and data flow

## Issue Creation
Follow the detailed process in `.claude/commands/make-work.md` for:
- Issue format and structure
- Using `bd create` and dependency management
- Proper syncing and committing

## Validation
After creating initial documentation, run **`mage analyze`** to check for:
- Orphaned PRDs (not referenced by use cases)
- Missing test suites (use cases without test suites)
- Broken references (invalid touchpoints, missing files)
- Use cases not in roadmap

Fix any issues before finalizing.
