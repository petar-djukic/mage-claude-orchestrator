Pop a GitHub issue from the current repository, decompose it into GitHub sub-issues on a feature branch, and open a PR when all sub-issues are closed.

Uses native GitHub sub-issues instead of beads. Sub-issue progress is visible directly on the parent issue page.

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

If arguments contain an issue number (e.g. `42` or `#42`), use that issue. If arguments contain a URL, extract the issue number. If no number is given, list open issues and ask the user to pick one.

## Phase 0 -- Detect Repository

1. Run `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner` and use the result as `<owner>/<repo>` for all `gh` commands below.

## Phase 1 -- Fetch the GitHub Issue

1. Fetch the issue:
   ```
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state
   ```
2. If the issue is not open, stop and report its state.
3. Display the issue title, body, and labels to the user.

## Phase 2 -- Gather Project Context

1. Read VISION.yaml, ARCHITECTURE.yaml, road-map.yaml, and `docs/constitutions/design.yaml`.
2. Read READMEs for product requirements and use cases relevant to the issue.
3. List open sub-issues already attached to this parent (in case this is a resumed session):
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/sub_issues --jq '[.[] | {number: .number, title: .title, state: .state}]'
   ```
4. Run `mage analyze` to identify spec issues.
5. Run `mage stats` for current LOC and documentation metrics.
6. Summarize the current project state.

## Phase 3 -- Propose Sub-Issues

Using the GitHub issue as the epic, propose sub-issues that decompose it into actionable work:

- Type: documentation or code
- Required Reading: mandatory list of files the agent must read
- Files to Create/Modify: explicit file list
- Structure: Requirements, Design Decisions (optional), Acceptance Criteria
- Code task sizing: 300-700 lines of production code, no more than 5 files
- No more than 10 sub-issues

Present the proposed breakdown to the user for approval. Do not create anything until the user agrees.

## Phase 4 -- Create Branch and Sub-Issues

After user approval:

1. Ensure `main` is clean and up to date:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git stash --include-untracked  # if needed
   ```

2. Create a feature branch from main:
   ```
   git checkout -b gh-<number>-<slug>
   ```
   Where `<slug>` is a short kebab-case summary of the issue title (e.g. `gh-42-add-scaffold-validation`).

3. Create each sub-issue on GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --repo <owner>/<repo> \
     --title "<sub-issue title>" \
     --body "<structured description with Required Reading, Files to Create/Modify, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria>"
   ```
   Capture the issue number returned for each sub-issue.

4. Link each sub-issue to the parent using the GitHub sub-issues API:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent-number>/sub_issues \
     --method POST \
     --field sub_issue_id=<sub-issue-number>
   ```
   Repeat for each sub-issue. The parent issue will show a progress checklist.

5. Commit the feature branch (no beads state to commit — just record the branch creation):
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Pop GH-<number>: <title> into feature branch

   Sub-issues: <comma-separated list of #N>"
   ```

6. Push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin gh-<number>-<slug>
   ```

7. Report the parent issue URL and the list of sub-issue URLs to the user.

All subsequent `/do-work-gh` happens on this branch. Before starting work, verify you are on the correct branch:
```
git branch --show-current  # should show gh-<number>-<slug>
```

## Phase 5 -- Open a Pull Request

When ALL sub-issues on the parent are closed:

1. If the issue is recurring (see Phase 6), execute Phase 6 now — before merging — so the next instance exists before this one closes.

2. Verify all sub-issues are closed:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>/sub_issues \
     --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
   ```
   If the count is not 0, do not proceed — report which sub-issues are still open.

3. Push the final state of the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

4. Open a pull request against `main`:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo> \
     --base main \
     --head gh-<number>-<slug> \
     --title "GH-<number>: <title>" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary

   <2-3 sentence summary of what this epic delivered>

   ## Changes

   <bulleted list of sub-issues completed and what each produced, with #N references>

   ## Stats

   <output of mage stats with deltas from start of epic>

   ## Test plan

   - [ ] `mage analyze` passes
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] Documentation reviewed for consistency

   Closes #<number>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   The `Closes #<number>` line auto-closes the parent GitHub issue when the PR merges.

5. Merge the pull request and delete the remote feature branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge --repo <owner>/<repo> --merge --delete-branch
   ```

6. Return to main and pull the merged changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

7. Delete the local feature branch (now merged):
   ```bash
   git branch -d gh-<number>-<slug>
   ```

8. Verify the parent GitHub issue was closed by the merge:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json state -q .state
   ```
   If still open, close it explicitly:
   ```bash
   gh issue close <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --comment "Completed via PR #<pr-number>"
   ```

9. Report the PR URL and confirm the issue is closed.

**Note:** Phase 5 may happen in a later session. When running `/do-work-gh` and closing the last sub-issue, check the open sub-issue count and execute Phase 5 automatically if it reaches 0.

## Phase 6 -- Re-create Recurring Issues

A GitHub issue is recurring if its title starts with "Recurring:" or its body contains a "## Recurrence" section. After Phase 5 closes a recurring issue, re-create it so the next run can pick it up.

1. Detect recurrence: check whether the original issue title starts with `Recurring:` or the body contains `## Recurrence`.

2. If recurring, create a new issue with the same title, labels, and body as the original, except update the "Previous Runs" or "Previous Audits" section to append a line referencing the just-closed issue:
   ```
   - #<number> (<date>): <one-line summary of what this run produced>. PR #<pr-number>.
   ```

3. Create the new issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --repo <owner>/<repo> \
     --title "<same title>" \
     --label "<same labels, comma-separated>" \
     --body "<updated body>"
   ```

4. Report the new issue URL so the user knows the recurring issue is ready for the next run.
