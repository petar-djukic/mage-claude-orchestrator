# mage-claude-orchestrator

Go library for automating AI code generation via Claude Code. Consuming projects import this library through their Magefile and run generation cycles that propose tasks (measure) and execute them in isolated git worktrees (stitch). Claude runs inside a podman container for process isolation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Your target project must have:

- ✅ Go module initialized (`go.mod` exists)
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ On the `main` branch with a clean working tree

### Step 1: Clone the Orchestrator

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mesh-intelligence/mage-claude-orchestrator.git
cd mage-claude-orchestrator
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Target Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize Go module (if not already done)
go mod init github.com/your-username/your-project

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout -b main 2>/dev/null || git checkout main
```

### Step 3: Scaffold Your Project

From the **orchestrator repository**:

```bash
cd /path/to/mage-claude-orchestrator

# Absolute path
mage test:scaffold /path/to/your/project

# OR relative path (both work)
mage test:scaffold ../your-project
```

The scaffold automatically:

- Copies `orchestrator.go` to `magefiles/orchestrator.go` in your project
- Detects project structure (module path, main package, source directories)
- Generates `configuration.yaml` with detected settings
- Wires `magefiles/go.mod` with orchestrator dependency
- Copies design constitution to `docs/constitutions/design.yaml`
- Creates version template if main package detected

### Step 4: Initialize and Run

In **your target repository**:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize beads issue tracker
mage init

# Configure Claude credentials (see Configuration section below)
# Edit configuration.yaml and add your Claude API key or session

# Start your first generation
mage generator:start       # Create generation branch from main
mage generator:run         # Run measure+stitch cycles
mage generator:stop        # Merge generation into main
```

If a run is interrupted, `mage generator:resume` recovers state and continues. To discard a generation, `mage generator:reset` returns to a clean main.

### Files Created by Scaffold

    ├── go.mod                  # Separate module for build tooling
    └── go.sum
```

The `magefiles/` directory keeps build tooling dependencies separate from your project dependencies.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Go 1.25+ | Build and run |
| [Mage](https://magefile.org/) | Build system; orchestrator methods are exposed as Mage targets |
| [Beads](https://github.com/mesh-intelligence/beads) (bd) | Git-backed issue tracking |
| Podman | Container runtime for Claude execution |

## Podman Setup

Claude runs inside a podman container. The orchestrator wraps every Claude invocation in `podman run` with the repository directory mounted into the container.

### 1. Install Podman

On macOS:

```bash
brew install podman
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

On Linux (Fedora/RHEL):

```bash
sudo dnf install podman
```

On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install podman
```

### 2. Prepare the Claude Image

The container image must have the `claude` CLI installed. Build or pull an image that includes it, then set `podman_image` in your configuration.yaml.

### 3. Verify

```bash
podman run --rm <your-image> claude --version
```

If this prints a version string, podman is ready.

### 4. Configure

Set `podman_image` in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
podman_image: "your-claude-image:latest"
```

Optional extra arguments (environment variables, additional mounts):

```yaml
podman_args:
  - "-e"
  - "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-..."
```

The orchestrator runs a pre-flight check before every measure and stitch phase. If podman is not installed or cannot start a container, it exits with instructions pointing here.

## Three-Phase Constitution Architecture

The orchestrator uses three constitutions aligned with the three workflow phases:

### 1. Design Constitution

**Phase:** Interactive design/architecting (writing VISION, ARCHITECTURE, PRDs, use cases, test suites)

**Location:** Scaffolded to consuming projects as `docs/constitutions/design.yaml`

**Contains:** Documentation standards, format schemas for all document types, traceability model

**Used by:** Human or Claude in interactive mode writing specifications

The design constitution includes:

- Articles D1-D5: Specification-first, YAML-first, test suite linkage, traceability, roadmap-driven releases
- Documentation standards: Strunk & White style, forbidden terms, figure formats
- Document types: VISION, ARCHITECTURE, PRD, use case, test suite, engineering guideline, specification
- Naming conventions and completeness checklists for each document type

### 2. Planning Constitution

**Phase:** Breaking down work (measure)

**Location:** Embedded in orchestrator binary (`pkg/orchestrator/constitutions/planning.yaml`)

**Contains:** Release priority, task sizing rules, issue structure (crumb-format), dependency ordering

**Used by:** Measure prompt to propose well-formed tasks

The planning constitution includes:

- Articles P1-P5: Release-driven priority, task sizing (300-700 LOC, ≤5 files), task limit, issue structure, dependency ordering
- Issue structure: Common fields, documentation vs code issues, example templates
- Deliverable types: ARCHITECTURE, PRD, use case, test suite, engineering guideline, specification

### 3. Execution Constitution

**Phase:** Implementing tasks (stitch)

**Location:** Embedded in orchestrator binary (`pkg/orchestrator/constitutions/execution.yaml`)

**Contains:** Go coding standards, design patterns, traceability, session completion, quality gates

**Used by:** Stitch prompt to ensure code quality and project conventions

The execution constitution includes:

- Articles E1-E5: Specification-first, traceability, no scope creep, session completion, quality gates
- Coding standards: Copyright headers, no duplication, design patterns (Strategy, Command, Facade, etc.)
- Project structure: cmd/, internal/, pkg/, tests/, magefiles/
- Error handling, concurrency, testing, naming conventions
- Session completion workflow and git conventions

When you run `mage scaffold`, the design constitution is automatically copied to the consuming project. The planning and execution constitutions are embedded in the orchestrator binary and injected into the measure (`pkg/orchestrator/prompts/measure.tmpl`) and stitch (`pkg/orchestrator/prompts/stitch.tmpl`) prompt templates respectively.

## Configuration

All options live in `configuration.yaml` at the repository root. For consuming projects, the orchestrator provides a scaffold command that detects project structure and generates configuration.yaml automatically:

```bash
mage test:scaffold /path/to/your/project
```

Alternatively, create `configuration.yaml` manually and set the project-specific fields (`project.module_path`, `project.binary_name`, `project.main_package`, `project.go_source_dirs`, `podman.image`).
