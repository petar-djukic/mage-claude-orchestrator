title: Generation Lifecycle Management

problem: |
  AI code generation produces many intermediate commits that should not
  pollute the main branch. Without a structured lifecycle for generation
  sessions, developers must manually create branches, manage tags, merge
  results, and clean up. Interrupted sessions leave stale branches and
  tags that require manual recovery.

goals:
  - G1: Define a generation lifecycle with clear states and transitions
  - G2: Automate branch creation, tagging, merging, and cleanup
  - G3: Support recovery from interrupted generation runs
  - G4: Provide listing and switching between multiple generations

requirements:
  R1:
    title: Generation Naming
    items:
      - R1.1: Generation names must follow the pattern {GenPrefix}{timestamp} where timestamp is formatted as 2006-01-02-15-04-05
      - R1.2: Tags must follow the pattern {generationName}-{suffix} where suffix is start, finished, merged, or abandoned

  R2:
    title: GeneratorStart
    items:
      - R2.1: GeneratorStart must verify the current branch is main
      - R2.2: GeneratorStart must tag the current main state as {generationName}-start
      - R2.3: GeneratorStart must create and switch to the generation branch
      - R2.4: GeneratorStart must reset the beads database and reinitialize with the generation prefix
      - R2.5: GeneratorStart must delete all Go source files (except magefiles) and re-seed from templates
      - R2.6: GeneratorStart must reinitialize go.mod with a fresh module and local replace directive
      - R2.7: GeneratorStart must squash intermediate commits into a single clean commit

  R3:
    title: GeneratorRun
    items:
      - R3.1: GeneratorRun must execute N cycles of measure followed by stitch
      - R3.2: Config.Cycles must control the number of cycles (default 1)
      - R3.3: GeneratorRun must use the current branch as the generation branch
      - R3.4: Each cycle must log its progress with cycle number and total

  R4:
    title: GeneratorResume
    items:
      - R4.1: GeneratorResume must resolve the generation branch from Config.GenerationBranch or auto-detect
      - R4.2: GeneratorResume must commit uncommitted work before switching branches
      - R4.3: GeneratorResume must prune stale worktrees and remove the worktree base directory
      - R4.4: GeneratorResume must recover stale tasks (reset orphaned in_progress issues to ready)
      - R4.5: GeneratorResume must reset the cobbler scratch directory
      - R4.6: GeneratorResume must drain existing ready issues before starting new cycles

  R5:
    title: GeneratorStop
    items:
      - R5.1: GeneratorStop must resolve the generation branch from Config.GenerationBranch, current branch, or auto-detect
      - R5.2: GeneratorStop must tag the generation as {generationName}-finished
      - R5.3: GeneratorStop must switch to main and prepare for merge by resetting Go sources
      - R5.4: GeneratorStop must merge the generation branch into main
      - R5.5: GeneratorStop must tag the result as {generationName}-merged
      - R5.6: GeneratorStop must create versioned tags (v{date}-code, v{date}-requirements) on main
      - R5.7: GeneratorStop must delete the generation branch after successful merge
      - R5.8: After merge, GeneratorStop must restore Go files that existed on main at the start tag but are missing after merge, preserving code from earlier generations

  R6:
    title: GeneratorReset
    items:
      - R6.1: GeneratorReset must switch to main
      - R6.2: GeneratorReset must remove all task branches and worktrees for all generation branches
      - R6.3: GeneratorReset must delete all generation branches
      - R6.4: GeneratorReset must rename unmerged generation tags to {generationName}-abandoned
      - R6.5: GeneratorReset must delete Go source directories and binary output
      - R6.6: GeneratorReset must re-seed template files and reinitialize go.mod
      - R6.7: GeneratorReset must commit the clean state

  R7:
    title: GeneratorList
    items:
      - R7.1: GeneratorList must show active generation branches with lifecycle tags
      - R7.2: GeneratorList must indicate the current branch with an asterisk
      - R7.3: GeneratorList must show all generations including abandoned ones

  R8:
    title: GeneratorSwitch
    items:
      - R8.1: GeneratorSwitch must use Config.GenerationBranch as the target branch
      - R8.2: GeneratorSwitch must commit uncommitted work before switching
      - R8.3: GeneratorSwitch must only switch to generation branches or main
      - R8.4: GeneratorSwitch must verify the target branch exists

  R9:
    title: Branch Resolution
    items:
      - R9.1: resolveBranch must return the explicit branch if provided and it exists
      - R9.2: resolveBranch must return the single generation branch if exactly one exists
      - R9.3: resolveBranch must return an error listing all branches when multiple exist
      - R9.4: resolveBranch must return the current branch when no generation branches exist

non_goals:
  - This PRD does not define what happens inside measure or stitch cycles (see prd003)
  - This PRD does not define multi-generation concurrency (one generation at a time)

acceptance_criteria:
  - GeneratorStart creates a tagged generation branch with clean state
  - GeneratorRun executes the specified number of measure+stitch cycles
  - GeneratorResume recovers from interruption and continues without data loss
  - GeneratorStop merges to main with correct tags and cleans up the branch
  - GeneratorReset returns to a clean main-only state
  - GeneratorList shows active, merged, and abandoned generations
  - GeneratorSwitch commits work and changes branches safely
