      Simple Go CLI with cmd/mcp-server. Exercises the default scaffold
      path (cmd/ subdir with main.go) and the full cobbler workflow.

preconditions:
  - On main branch with clean working tree
  - bd CLI available on PATH
  - mage available (go/bin/mage or PATH)
  - configuration.yaml present at repository root
  - "Sections 5, 7, 8 require: Claude CLI on PATH or podman with configured image"
